# Timer Class

The `Timer` class is a C++ class for managing time-related operations and timers. It allows you to create, start, stop, reset, and pause timers, making it useful for various timing and scheduling tasks in your Arduino projects.

## Features

- Start, stop, reset, and pause timers.
- Set target durations and check if a timer has reached its target.
- Synchronize with an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module.
- Get the current RTC time.
- Manage both running and paused states of timers.

## Usage

To use the `Timer` class, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary header file (`Timer.h`) in your C++ program.
2. Create an instance of the `Timer` class.

## Installation

```powershell
git clone "https://github.com/braydenanderson2014/C-Arduino-Libraries/tree/main/Timer.git"

```
## Header

If you want to Utilize this Library. Please include the 
```cpp 
#include <Timer.h> 
```

## ChangeLog
### Version 1.0.0:
* Initial Release 
### Version 1.0.1:
* Update to Libary.json
### Version 1.0.2:
* Added Debug Statements [TIMER]: 
### Version 1.0.3:
* Modified constructor to take in a ```bool``` to allow you to set whether or not the library displays debug messages.


    

Here's an example of how to use the `Timer` class:

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "Timer.h"

Timer myTimer;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    myTimer.setTargetMinutes(5);  // Set the target time to 5 minutes
    myTimer.start();  // Start the timer
}

void loop() {
    if (myTimer.hasReachedTarget()) {
        Serial.println("Timer has reached the target duration.");
        // Perform actions when the timer reaches the target.
        // You can also stop or reset the timer as needed.
    }
}

```
